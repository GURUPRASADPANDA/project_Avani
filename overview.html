        Urbanization is diminishing green spaces, resulting in environmental degradation, health challenges, and unsustainable development. Urban planners often lack effective tools to analyze and optimize green spaces, hindering sustainable city development. Project Avani addresses this gap by providing a data-driven AI-powered solution for sustainable urban planning and environmental management.</p>

        <p>Avani integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Random Forest machine learning, and advanced data analytics to help city planners make informed decisions. The platform is designed to optimize green spaces, improve urban living conditions, and enhance environmental health. Leveraging sensors for air quality, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, along with IoT-enabled devices like Arduino, Avani collects and transmits real-time environmental data to the cloud.<p>

        <p>GPS modules track sensor locations, enabling precise data mapping, while digital displays provide real-time data visualization. GIS tools are employed for spatial analysis, and the Random Forest ML model processes data to generate predictive insights for efficient green space management. By combining real-time monitoring with advanced analytics, Avani enables city planners to develop sustainable urban landscapes that balance environmental health and urban growth. This innovative approach fosters better urban living conditions and addresses key challenges of modern urbanization.
